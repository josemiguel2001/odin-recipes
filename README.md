Hey! This is my soluction for the project proposed on the foundations module of The Odin Project.

On this project, I will try my best to create a fully functional recipes website using HTML.
Besides the main HTML syntax teached in the TOP lessons, I will also try to work some Semantic HTML concepts I've learned on previous CodeAcademy tutorials on it.
I will be using the Phoenix Code IDE and KDE Neon OS.
