            <h2>What is "pudim"?</h2>
            <p>
                Pudim is a beloved Brazilian dessert similar to caramel flan. It’s creamy, smooth, and covered in a
                glossy layer of caramel syrup. The best part? It’s made with just a few simple ingredients you probably
                already have at home.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can (395g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 can (using the same can) of milk</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
                <li>Blend the condensed milk, milk, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour the caramel syrup (see below) into a round baking pan, tilting it so the bottom is coated.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture over the syrup and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in a water bath for about 1 hour, or until set (a knife should come out clean).</li>
                <li>Let cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours before unmolding.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>For the caramel syrup</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small pan, melt 1 cup of sugar over medium heat, stirring gently until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Carefully add ½ cup of hot water (it will bubble!) and stir until smooth.</li>
                <li>Let the syrup cool slightly before pouring it into the baking pan.</li>
            </ol>
