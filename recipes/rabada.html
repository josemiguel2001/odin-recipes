           <h2>What is "Rabada?"</h2>
           <p>
               Rabada is a hearty Brazilian stew made with oxtail slowly cooked until tender in a rich and flavorful sauce. It’s often enjoyed with polenta or mashed cassava and is especially popular on cold or rainy days. Its deep flavor comes from the slow cooking process that makes the meat fall off the bone — comfort food at its best!

           <h3>Ingredients</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>1.5 kg of oxtail, cut into pieces</li>
               <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
               <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
               <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
               <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
               <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
               <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
               <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
               <li>1 bay leaf</li>
               <li>200 ml beef broth or water</li>
               <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
               <li>1 bunch of green onions, chopped</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>Steps</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot and sear the oxtail pieces on all sides until browned.</li>
               <li>Remove the oxtail and in the same pot, sauté the onion, garlic, tomatoes, and bell pepper until soft.</li>
               <li>Return the oxtail to the pot, season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Add the bay leaf and beef broth.</li>
               <li>Cover and let cook on low heat for about 2–3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. Add more water if needed.</li>
               <li>Sprinkle with parsley and green onions before serving.</li>
           </ol>

           <h5>Para a polenta</h5>
           <ol>
               <li>In a saucepan, bring 3 cups of water to a boil and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
               <li>Slowly whisk in 1 cup of cornmeal. Stir constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
               <li>Cook on low heat for about 10–15 minutes, until thick and creamy.</li>
               <li>Serve the rabada over the polenta for a traditional pairing.</li>
           </ol>
